## 🎯 The Challenge

### Project Summary
In this project, you will use sensor data and deep learning to develop a fault diagnosis system for smart appliances, optimized for embedded applications. You will learn how to build, train, and compress AI models while gaining hands-on experience with industry tools and providing insights about their usability.

### Success Criteria
- Development of a deep learning model for a smart appliance fault diagnosis application
- Performance analysis including inference speed, memory footprint, and accuracy
- Application of at least two model compression techniques with documented trade-offs

### Project Milestones

Use these milestones to guide your work. Your team will create a **GitHub Projects board** to track tasks within each milestone.

| Month      | Milestone                     | Key Activities                                                      |
|------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **September** | Data Understanding & Preprocessing | Load and explore sensor data; visualize signals; apply standardization; document findings |
| **October** | Model Development & Compression | Train baseline model; apply pruning, projection, and quantization; compare accuracy/size/speed trade-offs |
| **November** | Evaluation & Presentation | Finalize models; document results; prepare final presentation |

> **Note for the team:** Please create a GitHub Projects board in this repository to break these milestones into weekly tasks. Go to the **Projects** tab → **New project** → Choose **Board** → Add columns for each month.

## 📊 Dataset

**Name:** Rolling Element Bearing Fault Diagnosis  
**Format:** MATLAB (.mat), can be read in Python using `scipy.io.loadmat()` or loaded directly in MATLAB  
**Size:** Under 1 GB  
**Location:** [data folder](data) (see `data/README.md` for full details on source, license, and how to load)

### Key Details
- Vibration acceleration data from rolling element bearings
- Three fault classes: **Normal** (healthy), **Outer Race Fault**, and **Inner Race Fault**
- Pre-split into train, validation, and test sets (balanced, segmented into 5,000-sample windows)
- The remaining preprocessing step is **standardization** before model training
- Known limitation: Data comes from a single test rig under controlled laboratory conditions.

## 🛠️ Suggested Approach

**ML Problem Type:** Classification (fault type identification from vibration signals)

**Recommended Tools & Libraries:**

| Category | Python Options | MATLAB Options |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| Data exploration | scipy, numpy, pandas, matplotlib | MATLAB built-in functions and graphics |
| Deep Learning | PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras | Deep Learning Toolbox |
| Model Compression | torch.quantization, torch.nn.utils.prune, TFLite | Deep Learning Toolbox Model Compression Library |
| Environment | Google Colab | MATLAB Online or MATLAB Desktop |

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- Classification Accuracy
- Model Size (MB)
- Compression Ratio (original vs. compressed)
- Inference Speed (ms per sample)
